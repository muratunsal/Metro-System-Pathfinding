# Metro System Pathfinding

This project implements a metro system pathfinding algorithm. The program models a metro system with stations and lines, supporting the addition of stations to lines and lines to the metro system. It includes functions to find neighboring stations, calculate travel distances, and determine the best path between two stations using a recursive search approach. The program reads input data, identifies the nearest metro stations to a given start and end point, and prints the optimal path between these stations.
